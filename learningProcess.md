## first step in my process

I tried to youtube some videos to grasp the idea of functional programming (which is foreign to me) and see if videos would help me in the learning process. I then realized that I am a hands-on learner and had to install Haskell on to my machine and start from the beginning.

I followed this youtube video to guide me into installing Haskell on my ubuntu/PC. I had a couple of hiccups with where I was installing it and at first I was watching a wrong video on installing it on my PC. I didn't want to install it there as I had ubuntu and wanted it to be install there. this video help with the process and I eventually got it working with some test code from the video.

## Second step

I attempted to google some beginners guide to Haskell but I found this wiki Haskell site that showed me in 5 step into writing my first program with Haskell. I created a git repo for just practicing Haskell and I would do all my coding there to understand the language.

## Third step

Then I stubbled onto Learn you a Haskell website which a book but they have it available online for free for you to follow taking baby steps. I actually enjoyed coding along and practicing different functions, list, etc. I had 1 week to go through the book which wasn't enough time for me to fully grasp the language but I did my best and tried to begin coding the tic tac toe project and refer to the book or online if I hit any speed bumps along the way.

## Haskell Tic Tac Toe Project

I felt overwhelmed but I know I would give it my best shot to see what I can do and make something work. I started a git repo for the project and from here I wanted to start with a I/O system. I made main equal to undefined so I could start building the game with functions and testing every function out seprately to make sure they work. The hardest part of this process was to switch my brain into something I have never done before. I have details of how I went about my code commented out in the tic-tac-toe.hs file and you can see for more detail and how I approached it.

At the end of the day I am proud that I was able to get something accomplished with the time I had and wanted really learn what each line was doing before I moved on. I think that may have hindered my progress but I feel like there is no point in moving foward if you don't know what you just done. This was a great learning experience and whether I move foward or not with the company intend to continue to learn Haskell for tools under my belt. I was once told that if your brain is hurting when you are super frustrated, it means that you brain is actually growing new neurons to make you a better learner/bigger brain (Lauren Chavez's fun facts).

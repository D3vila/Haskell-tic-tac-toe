# Haskell Tic Tac Toe Project

This week-long project was to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the Command Line interface using Haskell.
During this project I learned Haskell functional programming language in a week and attempted to do a quick turn around.

- to run this project:
- Clone it
- open terminal and cd into file
- type ghci tic-tac-toe.hs to compile file

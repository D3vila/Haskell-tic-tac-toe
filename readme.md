# Haskell Tic Tac Toe Project

This project was to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the Command Line interface using Haskell.
During this project, I attempted to learned Haskell functional programming language in a week and attempted to do a quick turn around. It will be a work in progress to complete it since I have never heard of Haskell but will attempt to switch gears with my brain to understand functional programming.

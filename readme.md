# Haskell Tic Tac Toe Project

This project was to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the Command Line interface using Haskell.
During this project, I attempted to learned Haskell functional programming language in a week and attempted to do a quick turn around. It will be a work in progress to complete it since I have never heard of Haskell but will attempt to switch gears with my brain to understand functional programming.

## learningProcess.md
This file has all my thoughts and process on how I attempted to learn Haskell in a week and what I used as resources to get me there.

## tic-tac-toe.hs
This file is where I have my code and how I attempted to make the game. I feel like I gave it my best shot to and there was success with failures and I learned alot from where I started and want to continue to work on it in the future to make sure I does work one day with some future implementation.

to test functions I have completed:

- clone project
- cd into file
- type ```ghci tic-tac-toe.hs``` in the terminal
- once ```[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( tic-tac-toe.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
*Main> ```
